- Created a new branch and merged them with the master branch

- Started working on the challenges

Challenge 1:

- Syntax error - missed '=' tried fixing it by adding and fixed it.

Challenge 2:

- Missing argument - Passed an argument inside the function which solved  the challenge.

Challenge 3:

- Declared as integer and argument passed as string ,which after changing the argument the issue is solved.

Challenge 4:

- Indentation error - After proper indentation the issue has been fixed.

Challenge 5:

Challenge 9:

- In this the range is given as   for i in range(6,max_num)  so the output started from 6 , tried fixing it by changing        for i in range(1,max_num) which solved the issue.

Challenge 10:

- Throwed an error 'module' object not callable , fixed issue by changing the filename added it to the challenge file by from sathyan import fizzbuzz - which helped to solve the issue.

	- Read this post and here are my notes:
		- How a simple mindset shift can have more impact on your project than zillion programming languages.

Way of working
```
 >Target Mindset :
         `1` : `Continous delivary: Software is always in relesable state.`

         `2` : `Test early to avoid bugs and analyze the quality of the product.`

 >**Mindset we need to move**:
        `1` : `Waterfalled agile: Software needs to be brought to relesable state.`

        `2` : `Testing later aiming to find the bugs in already development feautres.`
```

When to test

Target mindset:
```
  `1` : `Start with the test to increase the predictable of the end result.`

  `2` : `Do exploratory testing during the development.`
```

Mindset we need to move :
```
   `1` : `End with the test before deployment.`

   `2` : `Bugs might have been introduced during the development, our role is to find them.`
```

Who is responsible for quality?

Target mindset:
```
  `1` : **Everyone responsible for quality** : `Put the quality front and center, not at the end of the pipeline. The whole team is quality focused.`

  `2` :`Fewer resources can do more.`
```

Mindset we need to move:
 1 : **Only QA team is responsible for quality**:  Put the quality as a last line of defense.
2 : Higher and higher resources are needed to defeat the quality issues.`


When to deliver

Target Mindset:

1 : Deliver faster and smaller: Deliver a small amount of code and more frequently.

2 : High quality comes from working in small, fast, definitive steps that we can monitor as we create the change.

Mindset we need to move:

1 : Deliver a large amount of code at once.

2 : It is more difficult to validate the quality of software when it is big.

Quality assurance or quality

Target Mindset:

1 : QA over quality control: The main focus is an efficient way of working and building harmony across the teams.

2 : Constant feedback mechanism to improve the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) pipeline.

Mindset we need to move:

1: Quality control only: The main focus is checking the final result.

2: Quality becomes a concern when problems arise. Feedback is received during the final tests.

What is QA?

Target Mindset:

1: QA means Quality Assurance: QA team is in an advisor position from the beginning of the development to the end. The focus is more on quality rather than bug finding.

2: QA should not find bugs. When a bug is found, it is not only supposed to be fixed but the root cause should be investigated.

Mindset we need to move:1 : QA means gatekeeper: QA team is a tester and bug-finder.
2 : QA should find the bugs and then bugs should be fixed without further investigation. Bug is only a software issue.
